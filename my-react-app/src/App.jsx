    <p className="Avian">Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrate animals constituting the 
      class Aves, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs,
       a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
        Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8
         m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species and they are split into 
         44 orders. More than half are passerine or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further
          evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins.</p>
